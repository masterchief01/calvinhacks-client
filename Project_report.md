## What it does
The application has a mapbox via which the user can select a location through the given marker. This gives a modal pop-up which gives the covid rating for the surrounding locations.  The covid rating of a place is a parameter which represents how often do people follow covid safety protocols. This would help the user know whether it is safe to visit these places in this covid era. 

## How we built it
We built it using node, express.js , react, mongodb. We built this on top of mapbox api
